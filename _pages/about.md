Hello, I am **Federica Picogna**, currently a PhD researcher at **Nyenrode Business Universiteit**.  
My doctoral project focuses on evaluating **algorithmic fairness** using various **fairness measures**, with a particular emphasis on the application of **Bayesian statistical methods** for algorithmic fairness assessment.  

I also work on translating complex statistical concepts into practical terms that **auditors** can use when conducting AI audits, so that algorithmic outcomes can be evaluated rigorously and correctly. My PhD work is supervised by **Prof. Dr. Jacques de Swart**, **Prof. Dr. Ruud Wetzels**, and **Prof. Dr. Koen Derks**.  

I am actively involved in **teaching**, for which I obtained the **BKO certification** and am currently pursuing the **BKE certification**.  

In addition to my academic and teaching work, I am employed as a **Data Analyst at the Belastingdienst**, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This role allows me to apply and test the methodologies I develop on real-world data, bridging the gap between research and practice.  

I contribute to **statistical software development**, working on **JASP** and maintaining the **jfa package for R** ([link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jfa/jfa.pdf)), which implements the methods I describe in my publications.

You can explore my work through the **Publications**, **Teaching**, and **Talks** pages.
